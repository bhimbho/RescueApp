This project has the aim of responding to a need or a gap that we have while documenting and organizing the search for missing persons, especially when a large number of people are participating in the search. Organizing and documenting a service involving many emergency teams is a very complex task and requires the mastery of a variety of computer tools. These tools in many cases do not allow the exchange of live information and do not permit different people to work on the same file simultaneously. Furthermore, after each search is concluded, the data is stored in digital or paper archives. This significantly complicates later analysis.
The aim of this web app is to overcome these shortcomings.

## Objectives in detail
* To create
  * a single database where the data from each search is stored, in which different people will be able to work simultaneously and from different locations.
  * an intuitive and simple environment, where users with less experience will be also able to work effectively.
  * a table to enter data from previous searches.
  * a tool that
    * generates reports and search maps easily.
    * views and extracts statistics from this database.
    * identifies patterns of behaviour based on the profiles of the missing person.
    * will allow users to attach GPS tracks of the response teams to validate the tasks performed.
  * a dynamic vulnerability table from the search data.
* To integrate the database into a GIS from where the action plan and the subsequent follow-up can be undertaken.
