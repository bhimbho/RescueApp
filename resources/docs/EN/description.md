## [About](/{{route}}/{{version}}/description#about)
RescueApp is a powerful platform designed to streamline, coordinate, and comprehensively document search and rescue operations. It integrates advanced tools for analysis and facilitates informed decision-making, allowing multiple team members with varying permissions to collaborate seamlessly during search missions across different locations within a territory.

The application incorporates Geographic Information System (GIS) tools, recognizing the critical role of geospatial data in search and rescue efforts.

RescueApp helps in the following ways:
- **Organise**: The platform consolidates all necessary tools within a web-based interface, simplifying workflow management. Simultaneous remote access ensures real-time information sharing among team members. As a browser-based application, it offers accessibility from any device with an internet connection.

- **Coordinate**: RescueApp provides tools to oversee and manage all resources deployed for the mission. Live tracking via cartographic tools allows for resource allocation and task monitoring.

- **Document**: All data entered into the system is securely stored in the database. This archive can be accessed to review previous missions and generate comprehensive reports, including data, tasks completed, and maps.

- **Analysis**: RescueApp employs descriptive data to dynamically create Vulnerability Tables, enabling tailored responses to specific situations. Additionally, it generates Behavior Patterns based on missing persons' profiles, continuously updating as new information becomes available through ongoing services.

## [Is it useful for any type of research?](/{{route}}/{{version}}/description#useful)
RescueApp serves a dual purpose. For straightforward searches, it offers data collection and search closure tools, which are valuable for maintaining a database of information. This stored data can then be utilized with the analysis tools for future operations.

For complex searches involving multiple participants and intricate logistics, the cartographic and task logging tools are indispensable. They facilitate the coordination and organization of various team members, enhancing the success rate of missions.
